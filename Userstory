As a Payment Operations
I want to have a new reconsiliation report. 
to have all data  stored in BDAR to create a Cognos/BI Report on top.

Prerequesites:
Concept see https://orangesharing.com/x/-mhrI
To Do's:
Create new tables for SME/BB processing 
New table  TXM.BB_TRANSACTION  copy from FRAUD_VERDACHTSFAELLE

not columns ( MIAB_NR_ERST, MIAB_NR_AEND, DAT_AEND, ENTSCHEIDUNG_*,  MANUAL_RESPONSE_FILE_FLAG, DAT_LOCK, DAT_LOCK_BEARBEITER)

New additional columns in table BB_TRANSACTION

add new column MessageID (VARCHAR35)
add new column FileRef (VARCHAR18)
add new column SumMessageID(VARCHAR35)
add new column IntrBkSttlmDt(VARCHAR35)

-----------------------------------

New Table  TXM.BB_DECISION 

(System responses and manual responses will be written in this table with the results like in the current system hold, go, stop  for both TXM/TCM and RiskShield)

have columns (
TRANSACTIONID VARCHAR(100)
STATUS VARCHAR (10)
DAT_ERST DATE
Primary key for this table (TransactionId + Asset + Status)

Store new entry decisions on HOLD/GO/STOP in TXM/RiskShield and TCM in BB_DECISION 
column ASSET varchar(3) : values should be "TXM", "RS", "TCM" to distinguish between TXM/RS/TCM decisions. First we will only have TXM and TCM. Later when RS takes over we will see only RS and TCM.
column RSSCORE integer score from "RS" should be stored
column RSCOMMENT varchar(1000) comment from "RS" should be stored
column RSEVENTID varchar(100) eventId from "RS" should be stored
column RSREQUESTID varchar(100) eventId from "RS" should be stored

--------------------------
Create new tables FOR RETAIL

New table name TXM.RETAIL_TRANSACTION copy from BB_TRANSACTION
New table name TXM.RETAIL_DECISION copy from BB_DECISION
